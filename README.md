# Digital-Twin-Based-Fault-Diagnosis-of-Buck-Converters-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
The project creates a digital twin of a buck converter to simulate faults and normal operation. Features from signals train ML and DL models like RF, MLP, CNN, and LSTM to classify conditions, enabling predictive maintenance and intelligent fault detection in power electronics.
